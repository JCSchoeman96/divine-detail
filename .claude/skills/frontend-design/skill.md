# Divine Detail Frontend Design Skill (SvelteKit + Tailwind v4 + shadcn-svelte)

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces for **Divine Detail** that avoid generic “AI slop” aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Project Context (Truths you must not violate)

**Platform**
- Framework: SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 (runes API in use; `$props()` etc.)
- Deployment: Cloudflare Pages using `@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare`
- Runtime: Cloudflare Workers/Pages Functions (`nodejs_compat` flag enabled)
- Tooling: Bun, Vite 7
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite` (CSS-first; no tailwind.config.* by default)
- Design tokens: CSS variables + Tailwind v4 `@theme inline` tokens (already present in `layout.css`)
- UI library: shadcn-svelte available (components.json configured; TypeScript true)
- Icons: `@lucide/svelte`
- Utilities: `cn()` helper (`utils.ts`) using clsx + tailwind-merge

**Brand Palette (non-negotiable)**
- Primary: `#d68e85` (accent / CTA / highlight)
- Dark/background: `#211e1e` (foundation / depth / luxury)

**Brand position**
- “Luxury-refined, warm, grounded” is the default direction unless the user requests otherwise.

## Design Thinking (MANDATORY before coding)

Before writing code, do a short internal plan and then execute. Commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What page/component is being built? Who is it for (bridal makeup, Pretoria/Gauteng)?
- **Tone**: Choose one extreme and own it: luxury/editorial, brutal minimal, soft romantic, art deco geometric, etc.
- **Constraints**: Cloudflare Pages, SvelteKit, performance, accessibility.
- **Differentiation**: Define a single “signature moment” the user will remember (e.g. a hero layout, texture system, motion reveal, typographic treatment).

**CRITICAL**: Intentionality beats intensity. Pick a direction and execute precisely.

## Divine Detail Design Laws (Hard Rules)

### 1) Palette usage
- Use `#211e1e` (and its derived neutrals) as the dominant backdrop. This is a luxury site—depth matters.
- Use `#d68e85` as a controlled accent: buttons, links, highlights, badges. Avoid full-page pink washes.
- Always ensure **WCAG AA contrast** for text.

### 2) Tokens first, not ad-hoc styles
- Prefer existing `layout.css` tokens and Tailwind `@theme inline` mappings.
- If a new token is needed, add it deliberately (CSS variables + `@theme inline`) rather than hard-coding random hex values.

### 3) shadcn-svelte is the component baseline
- Use shadcn-svelte components where appropriate (Button, Card, Sheet, DropdownMenu, Input, Textarea, Label, Badge, Separator, Accordion/Tabs/Table).
- Keep custom components consistent with shadcn patterns and tokens.

### 4) Typography must be distinctive (no generic defaults)
- Avoid: Arial, Roboto, “system” stacks, and tired AI defaults.
- Choose a characterful display font + clean body font pairing.
- Must be implemented (e.g., via `app.html` or CSS import) and used consistently.
- Typography should feel editorial and premium (intentional sizes, line heights, letter-spacing).

### 5) Motion: one signature sequence beats lots of noise
- Prioritize one orchestrated load reveal (staggered, subtle, elegant).
- Add micro-interactions where they matter: CTA hover, nav transitions, card focus.
- Respect reduced motion (`prefers-reduced-motion`).

### 6) Composition: avoid cookie-cutter layouts
- Use asymmetry, overlap, controlled negative space, grid-breaking details.
- Add atmosphere: subtle grain/noise, soft gradients, layered borders, or decorative rules—always aligned with the chosen aesthetic.

### 7) Semantic HTML + accessibility are not optional
- Use `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, proper heading hierarchy.
- Forms must have labels, error states, focus rings, keyboard navigation.
- Images must have intentional alt text (local SEO-friendly when appropriate).

### 8) Performance discipline
- Lazy-load images, use responsive images where possible.
- Minimize JS bloat; prefer CSS for visual effects.
- Keep Core Web Vitals strong; Cloudflare doesn’t save you from bad frontend decisions.

## Output Requirements (What you must produce)

When the user asks for UI work:
1) **State the chosen aesthetic direction** in one sentence.
2) **List the components/files you will create or modify** (concrete paths).
3) Provide **working SvelteKit code** (not pseudocode).
4) Ensure:
   - tokens used (no random colors)
   - light/dark behavior (if theme exists)
   - hover/focus/active states
   - accessibility considerations
   - mobile-first responsiveness
5) If adding shadcn-svelte components, include the exact install/generate commands and the files they touch.

## Divine Detail Defaults (use unless overridden)

**Brand vibe defaults**
- Luxury / refined / warm / editorial.
- Dark theme-first with a clean, bright “paper” surface option where needed.

**Common page goals**
- Local SEO dominance: Pretoria + Gauteng + surrounding areas (e.g., Vanderbijlpark).
- EEAT signals: testimonials, galleries, clear contact details, service transparency.

## Anti-Slop Checklist (Fail the work if any are true)

- Uses generic fonts (Inter/Roboto/system) without a deliberate reason.
- Uses generic purple gradients or template-y hero sections.
- Repeats “SaaS landing page” layout clichés.
- Hardcodes random colors instead of tokens.
- No focus states / no semantic structure / poor mobile layout.
- “Looks nice” but is not functional code.
